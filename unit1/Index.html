		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<p>I’m a Graphics Designer, living in New York City. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because of a job opportunity at my current company.</p>

		<h2>My Mission</h2>

		<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a Digital Graphics, Web and User Experience Designer with my own company because I would like to eventually work remotely from anywhere in the world.</p>

		<h2>My Experience</h2>

		<ul>
			<li> <strong>Sr Graphics Designer for the Office of the CEO</strong>, Univision Communications Inc.
			<br> <em>New York, NY, 6/13-10/14</em> </li>

			<li> <strong>Sr Graphics Specialist</strong>, Credit Suisse (freelance)
